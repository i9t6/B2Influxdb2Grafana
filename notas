virtualenv myenv (this creates a new virtual environment. You can freely install packages in here without polluting your system-wide Python libraries. It will add (myenv) to your prompt.)

source myenv/bin/activate (this activates your environment; making sure your shell is pointing to the right place for Python)

pip install _____ (replace __ with whatever you want to install)

Once you are done type deactivate to reset your shell and environment to the default system Python.
